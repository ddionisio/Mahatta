According to http://ietf.org/rfc/rfc3629.txt we support up to 4-byte
(21 bit) sequences encoding the UTF-16 reachable 0-0x10FFFF.
Any byte not part of a 2-4 byte sequence in that range decodes to itself.
Ill formed (non-shortest) "C0 80" will be decoded as two code points C0 and 80,
not code point 0; see security considerations in the RFC.
However, UTF-16 surrogates (D800-DFFF) are accepted.

See http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/#Grapheme_Cluster_Boundaries
for default grapheme clusters.
Lazy westerners we are (and lacking the Hangul_Syllable_Type data),
we care for base char + Grapheme_Extend, but not for Hangul syllable sequences.

For http://unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UCD.html#Grapheme_Extend
we use Mn (NON_SPACING_MARK) + Me (ENCLOSING_MARK),
ignoring the 18 mostly south asian Other_Grapheme_Extend (16 Mc, 2 Cf) from
